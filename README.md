# BOPEngine
Graphical engine developed during the 5th semester at SUPSI with 2 colleagues on top of OpenGL1.


The graphical engine allow a user to upload a 3d scene from a file and to manipulate the scene with callbacks.

Note that many files weren't uploaded due to dimension issues.
The clientApp.exe can be downloaded and executed on a Windows machine to see the final project result: a scene loaded and manipulated
to have a dynamic light, a moving Gauntlet, statics camera and a dynamic camera.
